## Deployment Guide: From Local to Live with Supabase

Follow these instructions carefully to get your portfolio live.

### Part 1: Set Up Your Supabase Backend

1.  **Create a Supabase Project:**
    *   Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com), sign up, and create a new project.
    *   Save your **Project URL** and **`anon` public key**. You will need them later.

2.  **Create Database Tables:**
    *   In your Supabase project dashboard, navigate to the `SQL Editor`.
    *   Click `+ New query` and paste the entire content of the SQL script below. This will create your `projects`, `settings`, and `leads` tables.
    *   Click `RUN` to execute the script.

    ```sql
    -- 1. Create Projects Table
    create table projects (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      "name" text not null,
      "shortDescription" text,
      "longDescription" text,
      "projectUrl" text,
      technologies text[],
      complexity real,
      "projectDate" date,
      "isActive" boolean default true,
      avatar text,
      "avatarColor" text,
      created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
    );

    -- 2. Create Leads Table
    create table leads (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      email text not null,
      phone text,
      "projectId" bigint,
      "projectName" text,
      "date" text,
      created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
    );

    -- 3. Create Settings Table
    create table settings (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      "contactEmail" text,
      "siteTitle" text,
      "siteTagline" text,
      "aboutMe" text,
      updated_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
    );

    -- 4. Insert initial settings data (you will only have one row in this table)
    insert into settings (id, "siteTitle", "siteTagline", "aboutMe", "contactEmail")
    values (1, 'MindMesh Labs', 'Built by Devs. Backed by AI.', 'Welcome to my portfolio! I am a passionate developer specializing in creating modern, responsive, and user-friendly web applications.', 'your-email@example.com');

    -- 5. Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
    
    -- For PROJECTS table
    alter table projects enable row level security;
    create policy "Projects are viewable by everyone." on projects for select using (true);
    create policy "Authenticated users can manage projects." on projects for all using (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

    -- For LEADS table
    alter table leads enable row level security;
    create policy "Leads can be created by anyone." on leads for insert with check (true);
    create policy "Authenticated users can view leads." on leads for select using (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
    create policy "Authenticated users can delete leads." on leads for delete using (auth.role() = 'authenticated');


    -- For SETTINGS table
    alter table settings enable row level security;
    create policy "Settings are viewable by everyone." on settings for select using (true);
    create policy "Authenticated users can update settings." on settings for update using (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
    ```

3.  **Create Your Admin User:**
    *   In the Supabase dashboard, go to `Authentication` -> `Users`.
    *   Click `+ Add user` and create a user with an email and a strong password. **This will be your new admin login.**
    *   **Important**: You might receive a confirmation email. Make sure to confirm the user.

### Part 2: Deploy on Vercel (or other host)

1.  **Push Code to GitHub:** Make sure your latest code is on a GitHub repository.

2.  **Import Project to Vercel:**
    *   Log in to Vercel and import your GitHub repository.
    *   Vercel should auto-detect the Vite configuration. The build settings should be `npm run build` and the output directory `dist`.

3.  **Add Environment Variables:**
    *   In your Vercel project settings, navigate to `Settings` -> `Environment Variables`.
    *   Add the following variables. These are **required** for the app to work.

    | Key                       | Value                                         |
    | ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
    | `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`       | Your Supabase project URL.                    |
    | `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`  | Your Supabase `anon` public key.              |
    | `API_KEY`                 | Your Google Gemini API Key (for the AI Bot).  |

4.  **Deploy:**
    *   Trigger a new deployment in Vercel. It will use the environment variables you just set.
    *   Your site is now live! You can log in to the admin panel using the email and password you created in Supabase.
